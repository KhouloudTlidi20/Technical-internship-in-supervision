# Technical-internship-in-supervision
## Overview:
This summer I had as an internship project **Improving the supervision of alarms at the Agadir depot installation**, my tasks were: 
- Creating a SCADA interface to visualise the alarms using Tia portal.
- Receive an Sms in case of an alarm triggering.
- I added a visualization of alarms and control of threshold of level sensor and temperature sensor from node red dashboard or a mobile phone.\
I managed to do that with the help of node red cores. To send sms I worked with twilio node which relies on twilio service.

### üìå Keywords:
	API:
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you‚Äôre using an API. To illustrate this here is an analogy: The waiter is the messenger ‚Äì or API ‚Äì that takes your request or order and tells the kitchen ‚Äì the system ‚Äì what to do. Then the waiter delivers the response back to you; in this case, it is the food.
  
  Twilio:
Twilio is an American company specializing in unified communications via a cloud platform. Twilio allows software developers to make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its web service APIs.
  
  SCADA:
Refers to a category of software intended for the control of processes and the collection of data in real time from remote sites, in order to control equipment and operating conditions.

## üîß Tools:
- Node-Red installed locally (on your computer or on a raspberry pi).
- Basic knowledge in APIs.
- Tia portal v13 or more installed.

## üìú Steps to build the programme:
1. Create the program in Tia portal
2. Make a connection between Tia portal & Node-Red
3. Create your flow in Node-Red\
